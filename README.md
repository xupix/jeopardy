# Jeopardy! Project

## What is this?
This is a submission for the first project in a Juno (HackerYou) JavaScript course.
This is my first attempt at using JavaScript to design the logic in a webpage.
This project includes JavaScript and jQuery mostly, with pretty minimal HTML and CSS.

## Jeopardy!
### Rules
The rules are similar to Jeopardy, to an extent.
There's a table of topics and 5 questions in each.
There are 2 players, each giving a name and starts with $0.
Each turn a different player chooses a question and has to answer it.
A correct answer gives them an amount equal to the level of question they chose.
A wrong answer deducts that same amount from their total.
Their score (cash amount) is updated after every turn.
At the end of the game a winner will be announced as well as their total cash amount. 

### Phase I *DONE*
The basic HTML structure and the basic logic of the game will be created.
Basic database (JSON file) with questions in 7 categories.
Questions taken from [here](https://jeopardyquestions.com/).

### Phase II 
More improvements will be added (3rd player, option for each to answer any question, not just the player who selected the question).

### Phase III
Hook up the questions to the database.
